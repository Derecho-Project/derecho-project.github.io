# The Derecho Project

Derecho is an open-source C++ distributed computing toolkit, with an emphasis on providing strong forms of distributed coordination and consistency at RDMA speeds. Its goal is to be a library for building high-speed replicated systems on RDMA networks. The platform is currently under development by a Cornell-based team that includes Jonathan Behrens (@fintelia), Sagar Jha (@sagarjha), Matthew Milano (@mpmilano) and Edward Tremel (@etremel), as well as Professors Ken Birman and Robbert van Renesse. 


## Source Code

You can download the source code for Derecho from our main repository at <https://github.com/derecho-project/derecho/>. We currently don't have a stable release version, but expect to have one by late 2016. The code currently works well enough to run several experiments, and demonstrates incredibly fast speeds.
