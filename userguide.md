# A Brief User Guide

## Installation
Derecho is a library that helps you build replicated, fault-tolerant services in a datacenter with RDMA networking. Here's how to start using it in your projects.

### Prerequisites
* Linux (other operating systems don't currently support the RDMA features we use)
* A C++ compiler supporting C++14: GCC 5.4+ or Clang 3.5+
* The following system libraries: `rdmacm` (packaged for Ubuntu as `librdmacm-dev 1.0.21`), and `ibverbs` (packaged for Ubuntu as `libibverbs-dev 1.1.8`).
* CMake 2.8.1 or newer, if you want to use the bundled build scripts

### Getting Started
Since this repository uses Git submodules to refer to some bundled dependencies, a simple `git clone` will not actually download all the code. To download a complete copy of the project, run

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Derecho-Project/derecho-unified.git

Once cloning is complete, `cd` into the `derecho-unified` directory and run `cmake .`. You can now `cd derecho` and type `make` to compile the Derecho library and ensure all the test and experiment files can compile.

To add your own executable (that uses Derecho) to the build system, simply add an executable target to CMakeLists.txt with `derecho` as a "linked library." You can do this either in the top-level CMakeLists.txt or in the CMakeLists.txt inside the "derecho" directory. It will look something like this:

    add_executable(my_project_main my_project_main.cpp)
	target_link_libraries(my_project_main derecho)

To use Derecho in your code, you simply need to include the header `derecho/derecho.h` in your \*.h or \*.cpp files:
   
```cpp
#include "derecho/derecho.h"
```

## Using Derecho
The file `typed_subgroup_test.cpp` within derecho/experiments shows a complete working example of a program that sets up and uses a Derecho group with several Replicated Objects. You can read through that file if you prefer to learn by example, or read on for an explanation of how to use various features of Derecho.

### Replicated Objects
One of the core building blocks of Derecho is the concept of a Replicated Object. This provides a simple way for you to define state that is replicated among several machines and a set of RPC functions that operate on that state.

A Replicated Object is any class that (1) is serializable with the mutils-serialization framework and (2) implements a static method called `register_functions()`. The [mutils-serialization](https://github.com/mpmilano/mutils-serialization) library should have more documentation on making objects serializable, but the most straightforward way is to inherit `mutils::ByteRepresentable`, use the macro `DEFAULT_SERIALIZATION_SUPPORT`, and write an element-by-element constructor. The `register_functions()` method is how your class specifies to Derecho which of its methods should be converted to RPC functions and what their numeric "function tags" should be. It should return a `std::tuple` containing a pointer to each RPC-callable method, wrapped in the template function `derecho::rpc::tag`. The template parameter to `tag` is the integer that will be used to identify RPC calls to the corresponding method pointer, so we recommend you use a named constant that has the same name as the method. Here is an example of a Replicated Object declaration:

```cpp
class Cache : public mutils::ByteRepresentable {
    std::map<std::string, std::string> cache_map;

public:
    void put(const std::string& key, const std::string& value);
    std::string get(const std::string& key); 
    bool contains(const std::string& key);
    bool invalidate(const std::string& key);
    enum Functions { PUT,
                     GET,
                     CONTAINS,
                     INVALIDATE };

    static auto register_functions() {
        return std::make_tuple(derecho::rpc::tag<PUT>(&Cache::put),
                               derecho::rpc::tag<GET>(&Cache::get),
                               derecho::rpc::tag<CONTAINS>(&Cache::contains),
                               derecho::rpc::tag<INVALIDATE>(&Cache::invalidate));
    }

    Cache() : cache_map() {}
    Cache(const std::map<std::string, std::string>& cache_map) : cache_map(cache_map) {}

    DEFAULT_SERIALIZATION_SUPPORT(Cache, cache_map);
};
```

This object has one field, `cache_map`, so the DEFAULT_SERIALIZATION_SUPPORT macro is called with the name of the class and the name of this field. The second constructor, which initializes the field from a parameter of the same type, is required for serialization support. The object has four RPC methods, `put`, `get`, `contains`, and `invalidate`, and `register_functions()` tags them with enum constants that have similar names.

### Groups and Subgroups

Derecho organizes nodes (machines or processes in a system) into Groups, which can then be divided into subgroups and shards. Any member of a Group can communicate with any other member, and all run the same group-management service that handles failures and accepts new members. Subgroups, which are any subset of the nodes in a Group, correspond to Replicated Objects; each subgroup replicates the state of a Replicated Object and any member of the subgroup can handle RPC calls on that object. Shards are disjoint subsets of a subgroup that each maintain their own state, so one subgroup can replicate multiple instances of the same type of Replicated Object. A Group must be statically configured with the types of Replicated Objects it can support, but the number of subgroups and their exact membership can change at runtime according to functions that you provide. 

Note that more than one subgroup can use the same type of Replicated Object, so there can be multiple independent instances of a Replicated Object in a Group even if those subgroups are not sharded. A subgroup is usually identified by the type of Replicated Object it implements and an integral index number specifying which subgroup of that type it is. 

To start using Derecho, a process must either start or join a Group by constructing an instance of `derecho::Group`, which then provides the interface for interacting with other nodes in the Group. (The difference between starting and joining a group is simply a matter of calling a different constructor). A `derecho::Group` expects a set of variadic template parameters representing the types of Replicated Objects that it can support in its subgroups. For example, this declaration is a pointer to a Group object that can have subgroups of type LoadBalancer, Cache, and Storage:
```cpp
std::unique_ptr<derecho::Group<LoadBalancer, Cache, Storage>> group;
```

In order to start or join a Group, all members (including processes that join later) must define functions that provide the membership (as a subset of the current View) for each subgroup and shard, given as input the current View. These functions are organized in a map keyed by `std::type_index`, where the key for a subgroup-membership function is the type of Replicated Object associated with that subgroup. Since there can be more than one subgroup that implements the same Replicated Object type (as separate instances of the same type of object), the return type of a subgroup membership function is a vector-of-vectors: the index of the outer vector identifies which subgroup is being described, and the inner vector contains an entry for each shard of that subgroup. 

Here is an example of a declaration of a SubgroupInfo (which is the struct that contains the map of subgroup membership functions) that defines subgroups for two types of Replicated Objects, Foo and Bar. 

```cpp
derecho::SubgroupInfo subgroup_info{
    {{std::type_index(typeid(Foo)), [](const derecho::View& curr_view) {
          if(curr_view.num_members < 6) {
              throw derecho::subgroup_provisioning_exception();
          }
          derecho::subgroup_shard_layout_t subgroup_vector(1);
          subgroup_vector[0].emplace_back(curr_view.make_subview({0, 1, 2}));
          subgroup_vector[0].emplace_back(curr_view.make_subview({3, 4, 5}));
          return subgroup_vector;
      }},
     {std::type_index(typeid(Bar)), [](const derecho::View& curr_view) {
          if(curr_view.num_members < 5) {
              throw derecho::subgroup_provisioning_exception();
          }
          derecho::subgroup_shard_layout_t subgroup_vector(2);
          subgroup_vector[0].emplace_back(curr_view.make_subview({0, 1}));
          subgroup_vector[1].emplace_back(curr_view.make_subview({3, 4}));
          return subgroup_vector;
      }}}};
```
The function for Foo creates a vector with a single subgroup entry containing a size-2 vector, so it specifies that there will be one subgroup of type Foo, with two shards. It uses the convenience function `make_subview` to construct a SubView with a specific set of members; it assumes that the nodes in this Group will have IDs that sequentially increment from 0, so that a group with 6 members will have node IDs 0 through 5. By contrast, the function for Bar creates a vector with two entries, each of which is a size-1 vector, so it specifies that there will be two subgroups of type Bar, each of which has only one shard. Note that both functions throw `subgroup_provisioning_exception` if they receive an input View with fewer members than are necessary to construct their subgroups. Throwing this exception will cause the Group to stop setting up subgroups and wait for enough members to join before allowing any subgroup operations to proceed.


#### Constructing a Group

Although the SubgroupInfo is the most important part of constructing a `derecho::Group`, it requires several additional parameters.
* The **node ID** and **IP address** of the process starting or joining the group
* The **IP address of the Group's leader**, if a process is joining the group. The "leader" is simply the process with the lowest-numbered node ID in the group.
* A set of **callback functions** that will be notified when each Derecho message is delivered to the node (stability callback) or persisted to disk (persistence callback). These can be null, and are probably not useful if you're only using the Replicated Object features of Derecho (since the "messages" will be serialized RPC calls).
* For the process that starts the group, the **Derecho parameters** that specify low-level configuration options, such as the maximum size of a message that will be sent in this group and the length of timeout to use for detecting node failures.
* A set of **View upcalls** that will be notified when the group experiences a View change event (nodes fail or join the group). This is optional and can be empty, but it can be useful for adding additional failure-handling or load-balancing behavior to your application.
* For each template parameter in the type of `derecho::Group`, its constructor will expect an additional argument of type `derecho::Factory`, which is a function or functor that constructs instances of the Replicated Object (it's just an alias for `std::function<std::unique_ptr<T>(void)>`). 

### Invoking RPC Functions

Once a process has joined a Group and one or more subgroups, it can invoke RPC functions on any of the Replicated Objects in the Group. The options a process has for invoking RPC functions depend on its membership status:

* A node can perform an **ordered query** or **ordered send** to invoke an RPC function on a Replicated Object only when it is a member of that object's subgroup and shard. Both of these operations send a multicast to all other members of the object's shard, and guarantee that the multicast will be delivered in order (so the function call will take effect at the same time on every node). An ordered query waits for responses from each member of the shard (specifically, it provides a set of Future objects that can be used to wait for responses), while an ordered send does not wait for responses and thus should only be used to invoke `void` functions.
* A node can perform a **P2P query** or **P2P send** to invoke a read-only RPC function on any Replicated Object, regardless of whether it is a member of that object's subgroup and shard. These peer-to-peer operations send a message directly to a specific node, and it is up to the sender to pick a node that is a member of the desired object's shard. They cannot be used for mutative RPC function calls because they do not guarantee ordering of the message with respect to any other (peer-to-peer or "ordered") message, and could only update one replica at a time.

Ordered sends and queries are invoked through the `Replicated` interface, whose template parameter is the type of the Replicated Object it communicates with. You can obtain a `Replicated` by using Group's `get_subgroup` method, which uses a template parameter to specify the type of the Replicated Object and an integer argument to specify which subgroup of that type (remember that more than one subgroup can implement the same type of Replicated Object). For example, this code retrieves the Replicated object corresponding to the second subgroup of type Cache:
```cpp
Replicated<Cache>& cache_rpc_handle = group->get_subgroup<Cache>(1);
```
The `ordered_send` and `ordered_query` methods use their template parameter, which is an integral "function tag," to specify which RPC function they invoke; this should correspond to the same constant you used to tag that function in the Replicated Object's `register_functions()` method. Their arguments are the arguments that will be passed to the RPC function call. The `ordered_send` function returns nothing, while the `ordered_query` function returns an instance of `derecho::rpc::QueryResults` with a template parameter equal to the return type of the RPC function. Using the Cache example from earlier, this is what RPC calls to the "put" and "contains" functions would look like:
```cpp
cache_rpc_handle.ordered_send<Cache::PUT>("Foo", "Bar");
derecho::rpc::QueryResults<bool> results = cache_rpc_handle.ordered_query<Cache::CONTAINS>("Foo");
```

P2P (peer-to-peer) sends and queries are invoked through the `ExternalCaller` interface, which is exactly like the `Replicated` interface except it only provides the `p2p_send` and `p2p_query` functions. ExternalCaller objects are provided through the `get_nonmember_subgroup` method of Group, which works exactly like `get_subgroup` (except for the assumption that the caller is not a member of the requested subgroup). For example, this is how a process that is not a member of the second Cache-type subgroup would get an ExternalCaller to that subgroup:
```cpp
ExternalCaller<Cache>& p2p_cache_handle = group->get_nonmember_subgroup<Cache>(1);
```
When invoking a P2P send or query, the caller must specify, as the first argument, the ID of the node to communicate with. The caller must ensure that this node is actually a member of the subgroup that the ExternalCaller targets (though it can be in any shard of that subgroup). For example, if node 5 is in the Cache subgroup targeted above, this is how a non-member process could make a call to `get`:
```cpp
derecho::rpc::QueryResults<std::string> results = p2p_cache_handle.p2p_query<Cache::GET>(5, "Foo");
```

#### Using QueryResults objects

The result of an ordered query is a slightly complex object, because it must contain a `std::future` for each member of the subgroup, but the membership of the subgroup might change during the query invocation. Thus, a QueryResults object is actually itself a future, which is fulfilled with a map from node IDs to futures as soon as Derecho can guarantee that the query will be delivered in a particular View. (The node IDs in the map are the members of the subgroup in that View). Each `std::future` in the map will be fulfilled with either the response from that node or a `node_removed_from_group_exception`, if a View change occurred after the query was delivered but before that node had a chance to respond.

As an example, this code waits for the responses from each node and combines them to ensure that all replicas agree on an item's presence in the cache:
```cpp
derecho::rpc::QueryResults<bool> results = cache_rpc_handle.ordered_query<Cache::CONTAINS>("Stuff");
bool contains_accum = true;
for(auto& reply_pair : results.get()) {
	bool contains_result = reply_pair.second.get();
	contains_accum = contains_accum && contains_result;
}
```
Note that the type of `reply_pair` is `std::pair<derecho::node_id_t, std::future<bool>>`, which is why a node's response is accessed by writing `reply_pair.second.get()`.
